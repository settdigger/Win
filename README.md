A direct democracy

Hi! This is my Github website, devoted to our project <a href="https://github.com/settdigger/Erewhon">Erewhon</a>, a direct democracy. We would like to create a direct democracy! Thanks for reading.

Our view is that there are various inefficiencies in representative government; we want to cut out the middle man. We want to use the internet to govern ourselves.

The idea is in the air, it would seem: Zuckerberg opined recently that he would like to see some kind of voting via Facebook.

But rather than create merely an adjunct to existing governance systems, on a private network, we think it would be much stronger and more interesting to have a new governance system, on a public network.

Who are we? Just some people interested in direct democracy. I'm Robin Dunn; I live in Los Angeles. I'm not a coder but am interested to meet programmers and other talented people who like democracy. I and some other folks created a Facebook group, Erewhon; feel free to come say hi there if you like.

But really we need help from the ground up. We're not married to any particular architecture and are very open to ideas. All we have is some time, and a passion for this idea.

Thank you.
